My Projects

# [Project 1: Estimating the value of Pi using inscribed circle and Circumscribed circle with Python](https://github.com/BilalMaqsood-ai/Bilal_Portfolio/blob/main/Estimating%20the%20value%20pi%20.ipynb)
*	Visualized the data, did Exploratory data analysis(EDA) and achieved stationarity by differencing after finding the time series non-stationary using the AD Fuller test.
* Built a persistence model to get a benchmark for comparing the results, plotted autocorrelation plot and partial autocorrelation plot to decide on the optimum number of lags for the autoregression and moving average model before fitting the models.
* Integrated the 3-time series back to get the actual predictions, plotted it to compare with the actual results, and looked for the insights from the predictions to analyze the differences in investment decisions that we might have made based on predicted data vs the actual data.

  
# [Project 2: RFM analysis on actual Telecom Dataset for best pairing of customer and customer support representative]

* Calculated Revenue per transaction (RPT) of employees from the sales team and ranking them on this basis.
* Generated and ranking the clusters of customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis using K-means, mini-batch K-means, Mean Shift, and Agglomerative clustering and mapping them with the appropriate available employees from the Sales team.
  

# [Project 3: Estimating the value of Pi using inscribed circle and Circumscribed circle with Python](https://github.com/BilalMaqsood-ai/Bilal_Portfolio/blob/main/Estimating%20the%20value%20pi%20.ipynb)
*	Coded a favorite interview question of estimating the value of pi using an equilateral triangle.
*	Defined a function to call and try different values for for loop iteration.
*	Estimated the value of pi by up to 3 digits accurate after decimal points.
*	Plotted the scatter plot of the points using matplotlib library to visualize the results.
*	Tried the same for a Circumscribed circle
